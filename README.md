## Customization

### CSS Customization

- **Pagination Bullets**: Adjust the size, color, and position of the pagination bullets via the `.swiper-pagination-bullet` class.

### JavaScript Customization

- **Autoplay Timing**: Change the `autoplay` delay in the Swiper initialization script to set how long each testimonial stays on screen.
- **Responsive Settings**: Modify the `breakpoints` in the Swiper configuration to adjust how many slides are shown at different screen widths.
